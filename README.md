# Investment Calculator

The Investment Calculator is designed to help users estimate the growth of their investments over a given duration. 
By taking inputs like initial investment, annual contributions, expected annual return, and investment duration, it calculates and displays a yearly breakdown of the investment's performance.

ðŸ›  What Did I Do?
- Developed the calculator using ReactJS: Utilized state management to handle user inputs and calculations.
- Implemented a year-by-year breakdown: For each year, the calculator computes:
  - Year: The current year in the simulation.
  - End-of-Year Value: The total value of the investment after interest and annual investment.
  - Interest Earned: The interest earned in that year.
  - Total Interest Accumulated: Running total of all interest earned over the years.
  - Total Amount Invested: Cumulative investment including the initial and annual contributions.
- Utilized HTML, CSS, and JS: Created a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Built with Vite: For a fast and optimized development experience.
